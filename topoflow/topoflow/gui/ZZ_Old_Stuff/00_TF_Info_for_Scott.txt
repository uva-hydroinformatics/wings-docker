Step 1:  Run the routines in GUI_TopoFlow (GUI_main.pro) that load the
         structures with defaults.
          
         Get_Run_Vars, Get_Grid_Vars, etc.

Step 2:  Put all these into a "bunch" called "mstate", as done in (1).
         Don't worry about vars in "mstate" related to GUI yet.

Step 3:  (Optionally)  Override all of the defaults in the structures
         with a call to "load_all_tf_vars" (save_load.py).  This function
         needs mstate as an argument.  (Using this will require an input
         file from Scott generated with the IDL GUI.)  Would need to
         replace "dialog_pickfile" call with prompt for a filename at
         the command line.

Step 4:  Call Route_Flow (route.pro) with all the structures as input
         arguments and a few 1D arrays as (optional) output variables.
