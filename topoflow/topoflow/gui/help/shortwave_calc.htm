<h2>Create &rarr; RTS File for Qnet Shortwave Flux</h2>

<p>The input variables for modeling the net flux of shortwave
radiation are defined as follows:<br>
<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> T<sub>air</sub> </td>
<td> = air temperature [deg C] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> RH </td>
<td> = relative humidity [unitless]   (in [0,1]) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> albedo </td>
<td> = surface albedo [unitless]   (in [0,1]) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> dust att. </td>
<td> = dust attenuation factor [unitless]   (in [0,1]) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> factor </td>
<td> = cloud or canopy cover factor [unitless]   (in [0,1]) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> slope </td>
<td> = topographic slope [unitless, m/m]   (in [0,Infinity]) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> aspect </td>
<td> = aspect angle [radians]   (in [0,1]) </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>
</p>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>For DEMs with pixel geometry and bounding box given in terms of
Geographic coordinates, the latitude and longitude of each pixel is
used in the calculations.  For DEMs with a "fixed-length" pixel geometry
(e.g. UTM coordinates), which tend to span smaller areas, the dialog
prompts for a single lat/lon pair to be used in the calculations. </p>

<p><b>timestep:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
The timestep between frames in the new grid sequence (RTS file)
should typically be about one hour and should match the timestep
that will be used to model the Snowmelt or Evaporation processes.
The number of frames in the RTS file will depend on the start and
stop times, as well as the timestep.  The start time, stop time
and timestep should match those used to create the new longwave
radiation file with extension "*.Qn-LW". </p>

<p><b>time zone:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
The boundaries of time zones can be very irregular and a time zone
map should be consulted if you are unsure.  The time zone is not
simply a function of the longitude.  You can select an adjacent
time zone to include the effect of Daylight Savings Time.  Time
zones with non-integer offsets from GMT are not yet supported. </p>

<p><b>factor:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
This number can be used to account for cloud or
canopy cover.  It is simply multiplied by the "clear sky" value
of Q<sub>SW</sub>.  There are many different methods of computing this
factor from the fraction of the sky covered by clouds, C, and the
fraction covered by forest canopy, F. </p>

<p><b>slope:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Topographic slopes (not slope angles) are specified as dimensionless
numbers [m/m].  A RiverTools grid (RTG file) with extension
"_slope.rtg", "_mf-slope.rtg" or "_dinf-slope.rtg" can be used. </p>

<p><b>aspect:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Aspect is specified as an angle measured in radians counter-clockwise
from due east (the standard convention).
A RiverTools grid (RTG file) with extension "_mf-angle.rtg" or
"_dinf-angle.rtg" can be used for the (continuous-angle) aspect grid.

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p>This routine creates a grid sequence (RTS file format) of
clear-sky solar radiation flux, Q<sub>SW</sub>,
(shortwave radiation) that is used for the energy-balance
methods of Snowmelt and Evaporation.  Direct, diffuse and back-
scattered radiation fluxes are all modeled.  Properties of the
atmosphere such as air temperature, relative humidity and dust
attenuation are used as well as surface/topographic properties such
as slope angle, aspect angle and surface albedo.  The approach
followed here closely follows the one outlined in Appendix E of
Dingman (2002).  However, instantaneous vs. day-integrated
radiation fluxes are used and the optical air mass is modeled using
the widely used method of Kasten and Young (1989). </p>

<p>Q<sub>SW</sub> is set to zero between the times of local sunset and
local sunrise, so frames in the RTS file that correspond to nighttime
hours will contain only zeros. </p>
