<h2>Data &rarr; CUAHSI HIS Web Services</h2>

<p>As part of the <b><a href="http://his.cuahsi.org"> CUAHSI HIS project </a></b>, a
large and growing collection of hydrologic time series data has been made available
through a uniform web service called <b><a href="http://hiscentral.cuahsi.org">HIS Central
</a></b>.  The HIS Central website provides a
<b><a href="http://hiscentral.cuahsi.org/pub_services.aspx"> list of registered public data services</a></b>
and a separate information page for each service.  The HIS Central web
service uses WML (Watershed Markup Language) to create a single, standard interface
to this diverse and distributed set of web services.
A list of allowed "concept keywords" that can be used for queries can be found
<b><a href="http://water.sdsc.edu/hiscentral/webservices/hiscentral.asmx?op=GetSearchableConcepts"> here</a></b>.
A description of the WSDL interface functions can be found
<b><a href="http://water.sdsc.edu/hiscentral/webservices/hiscentral.asmx"> here</a></b>.
</p>

<p>The tabbed dialog for this component lets you create a query by entering a search keyword,
bounding box, start date, stop date, etc.  Once data has been downloaded from the web service,
it can either be saved to files or accessed directly by other components through the "Data"
port, which has a standard CSDMS IRF-based interface.  Note that this component must currently
be used in "stand-alone/driver" mode, so that the Run button will appear.
</p>

<p>Additional "Data" components that download data from online web services are planned for
the near future including a component to download seamless <i><b>USGS NED DEMs</b></i> and a
component to download grids and grid stacks using <i><b>OpenDAP</b></i>.</p>
