<h2>RTI File Format (RiverTools Information)</h2>

<p>RiverTools Information (RTI) files are small, ASCII
"header" files that contain georeferencing and other
descriptive information for a DEM grid file that has the
same prefix.  RTI files must conform to the following
rules, which are included at the bottom of every RTI file.
</p>

<ul>
<li> RiverTools Information filenames must end with ".rti".
<br> <br>
<li> The first line in the file should be: RiverTools Info File
<br> <br>
<li> Any line that starts with a semi-colon is ignored.
<br> <br>
<li> Colons are used to delimit labels from values.
<br> <br>
<li> Values must be listed in a "standard" order.
<br> <br>
<li> The number of rows and columns are required.
<br> <br>
<li> Pixel geometry codes are: 0=Fixed-Angle (Geographic),
1=Fixed-Length (usually UTM).
<br> <br>
<li> Pixel x-resolution and y-resolution are required.
<br> <br>
<li> Measurement units must be METERS or DEGREES.
<br> <br>
<li> Elevation data type is required.  Allowed types are:
     BYTE, INTEGER, LONG, FLOAT, and DOUBLE.
<br> <br>
<li> Byte order is required and must be specified as either
LSB or MSB.
   <ul>
   <li> (LSB = Least Significant Byte = little-endian)
   <li>(MSB = Most Significant Byte = big-endian)
   </ul>
<br> <br>
<li> For 'fixed-angle' pixels, bounding latitudes and longitudes
are required to compute lengths and areas correctly.
<br> <br>
<li> Bounding box coordinates are always for the outer edges
     of pixels as opposed to pixel centers.
<br> <br>
<li> Latitudes south of equator and longitudes west of prime
     meridian must be specified as negative numbers.
<br> <br>
<li> RTI files are most easily edited with the <b>File &rarr; View DEM
Info</b> dialog in RiverTools but are simple text files that can
also be created and edited with any text editor.
</ul>
