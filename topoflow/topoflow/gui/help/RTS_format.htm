<h2>RTS File Format (RiverTools Sequence)</h2>

<p>RiverTools Sequence (RTS) files are a simple extension
of the <b><a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG file format</a></b>
that allow a sequence of RTG files
to be stored in a single file.  That is, an RTS file is
a simple concatenation of RTG files that each have the
same data type.  The main purpose of this format is to
provide support for <b>landscape evolution models</b> and
<b>spatially-distributed hydrologic models</b> in the
RiverTools environment.  For example, a landscape
evolution model produces a sequence of DEMs, each of
which represents the topography of the landscape at a
particular time in its evolution.  Similarly, a
spatially-distributed hydrologic model may produce a
sequence of grids, each of which shows how water depths
or discharges are distributed spatially at a particular
time during a storm.</p>

<p>The various RTG files contained within an RTS file are
referred to as <b>frames</b>, and all of the frames are
assumed to have the same data type.  In version 3.0, only
the 4-byte floating point or <b>FLOAT</b> data type is
supported.  In TopoFlow, the frames in an RTS file can be
shown as an animation using <b>Plot &rarr; RTS File</b>.
Alternately, the <b>Display
&rarr; Grid Sequence</b> dialog in RiverTools 3.0 can
be used to create animations, save them in AVI file format,
or interact with them in various ways.  Note that an RTG
file with a data type of FLOAT is identical to an RTS file
with a single frame.</p>

<p>Unlike the file formats used for movies, no data
compression is used in RTS files because that would
result in a loss of information and each pixel of each
frame is assumed to represent valuable data.  As a result,
however, RTS files can be quite large and must therefore
be managed appropriately.  Typically, the number of rows
and columns for any given frame in an RTS file will be
numbers less than 500.  The filesize of an RTS file can
be computed as</p>

<center> <p>
filesize = (ncols x nrows x BPE x nframes)
</p> </center>

<p>where BPE is the number of bytes per element or pixel.
BPE is equal to 4 for the <b>FLOAT</b> data type and 8
for the <b>DOUBLE</b> data type.</p>
