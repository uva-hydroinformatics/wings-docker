<h2>Channel Flow &rarr; Dynamic Wave Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used for the Dynamic Wave method of
routing flow in channels are defined as follows:</p>

<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> flow_codes </td>
<td> = D8 flow codes (Jenson convention) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      [NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,N] &rarr; [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> bed_slope </td>
<td> = slope of the channel bed or hillslope [m / m] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Manning_n </td>
<td> = Manning roughness parameter [s / m<sup>1/3</sup>] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> bed_width </td>
<td> = bed width for trapezoidal cross-section [m] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> bank_angle </td>
<td> = bank angle for trapezoid [deg] (from vertical) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> sinuosity </td>
<td> = channel sinuosity [unitless] (along-channel / straight length) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> init_depth </td>
<td> = initial water depth [m] (See Notes below) </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The input variables for the dynamic wave method
should usually be specified as grids, except in special cases.
</p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>Flow directions are determined by a grid of D8 flow codes.
All grids are assumed to be stored as RTG (RiverTools Grid)
files and flow codes are assumed to follow the Jenson (1984)
convention (see above) that is also used for RiverTools D8
flow grids. Flow grids and slope grids can be created by
RiverTools or a similar program and the other grids can be
created using tools in the TopoFlow Create menu. </p>

<p>Bed slope, S, can be computed from a DEM by using the
<a href="smooth_DEM.htm">
<i><b>Create &rarr; Profile-smoothed DEM</b></i> </a> dialog or
by using hydrologic GIS software.
The current version assumes that all channels have <i><b>trapezoidal
cross-sections</b></i> (see Notes below) but allows bottom-width and
bank angle to vary spatially as grids.
TopoFlow has pre-processing tools in the <b>Create</b> menu
for creating grids of bed width, bank angle and bed roughness.  
The <a href="channel_grids_area.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr; Channel
Geometry Grids &rarr; With Area Grid</i></b> </a> tool allows
you to parameterize these variables as power-law functions of
contributing area.
The <a href="channel_grids_order.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr;
Channel Geometry Grids &rarr; With HS Order Grid</i></b> </a>
tool allows you to assign values based on Horton-Strahler order.
</p>

<p>Each pixel is classified as either a hillslope pixel (overland
flow) or a channel pixel (channelized flow) and appropriate
parameters must be used for each.  For overland flow, w >> d,
R<sub>h</sub> &rarr; d, and bank angle drops out.  Overland flow
can then be
modeled with a large value of Manning's <i>n</i>, such as 0.3.
For channelized flow, the variation of <i>n</i> with bed grain
size can be modeled with Strickler's equation as explained in
the Notes below. </p>

<p>If a sinuosity greater than 1 is specified, then bed slopes
are reduced by dividing them by this value.  As with the other
variables, it is most appropriate to specify a grid in this case.
</p>

<p><b>Important Note</b>:  It is physically unrealistic to specify
a spatially uniform initial flow depth by entering a scalar value
greater than zero for <i>init_depth</i>.  This will result in a
very large peak in the hydrograph and may cause TopoFlow to crash.
The <a href="init_depth.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr; RTG File for
Initial Depth</i></b> </a>  tool can be used to create a grid of
initial flow depths that varies spatially and is in steady-state
equilibrium with a specified baseflow recharge rate. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p>The <b>dynamic wave</b> method is the most complete and complex method for
modeling flow in open channels.  This method retains all of the terms in the
full, 1D momentum equation, including the gravity, friction and pressure gradient
terms (as used by the <b><i><a href="chan_diff_wave.htm">diffusive wave</a></i></b>
method) as well as local and convective acceleration (or momentum flux) terms.
This full equation is known as the <b><i>St. Venant equation</i></b>.  In the current
version of TopoFlow it is assumed that the flow directions are static and given
by a D8 flow grid.  In this case, integral vs. differential forms of the
conservation equations for mass and momentum can be used. </p>

<p><b>Conservation of mass</b>, in integral form, is represented by the first
three equations above.  The quantity, R, that appears in the first equation is
known as the <b><i>effective rainrate</i></b> or <b><i>excess rainrate</i></b>
and represents the sum of all vertical contributions to a grid cell's mass
balance.  R is computed as R = (P + M + G) - (I + E), where P = precipitation,
M = snowmelt, G = seepage from subsurface, I = infiltration and E = evapotranspiration.
(Note that R is technically <b>not</b> the same as the <b><i>runoff</i></b>, since
runoff includes horizontal fluxes.)  The summation sign in the first equation
adds up all horizontal inflows to a grid cell from its neighbor grid cells.
Mean channel flow depth, d, is then computed from channel geometry and the
water volume that is computed for the corresponding grid cell.  Note that channel
length depends on distance between grid cell centers and sinuosity, while
cross-sections are trapezoidal.  When the bank angle, &theta; is greater than
zero, the flow depth required to accomodate the water volume is computed by
solving the last equation (a quadratic) for d to get the second equation.  </p>

<p><b>Conservation of momentum</b>, in integral form, is represented by the
remaining equations above.  The term T<sub>3</sub> results from using the
equation for mass conservation to simplify the one for momentum conservation.
It represents the change in a grid cell's momentum balance due to the addition
or subtraction of mass within the cell from vertical fluxes.  Recall that
momentum represents a product of mass and velocity, so changes in momentum
can result from changes in mass or changes in velocity (chain rule). </p> 

<p>Notice that boundary-layer theory (which leads to the law of the wall)
allows us to compute the loss of momentum due to friction directly as a 
<b><i>separate process</i></b> and isn't really restricted to the special case
of <b><i>steady, uniform flow</i></b>.  By contrast, Manning's equation is
empirical and was found by studying steady, uniform flows.  It does not allow
us to cleanly separate the effects of friction and gravity;  it assumes
that they are in balance.
However, if we use the fact that Manning's equation is really just a power-law
approximation to the law of the wall, we can back-calculate a Manning's-equation
version of the friction term (and friction factor) which has been freed from
the assumption of steady, uniform flow.  </p>

<p>For more information, including definitions for undefined variables,
see the help pages for the simpler
<i><b><a href="channel_kin_wave.htm">kinematic wave</a></b></i> and
<i><b><a href="channel_diff_wave.htm">diffusive wave</a></b></i> methods. 
</p> 

<p><b>Note:</b>  In the current version of TopoFlow (1.5 beta), water-surface
slopes are set to zero if they ever become negative (implying upstream flow).
</p>

<p>It has also been assumed here that the water is incompressible; this allows
us to take the density of water, &rho;, to be a constant. </p>
