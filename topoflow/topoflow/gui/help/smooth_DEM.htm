<h2>Create &rarr; Profile-smoothed DEM</h2>

<p>This routine creates a "profile-smoothed" DEM from an input DEM.
The columns and rows of the pixels on a watershed's main channel are
read from the "profile file" and then a nonlinear least-squares
regression is used to find the parameters c and p in a slope-area
power-law relationship: S = c * A<sup>p</sup>, (sometimes called
Flint's law) that best fit the elevations and
areas for these main-channel pixels.  These parameters are then used
together with the grid of contributing areas in an iterative procedure
that creates a new DEM by assigning new, floating-point elevations to
every pixel in the original DEM.  The elevations in the new DEM should
be close to those in the original DEM, but there will no longer be
abrupt stair-step features and flats along profiles within which
slopes are zero (due to poor vertical resolution and integer-rounding).
Instead, the elevations and slopes will decrease smoothly along every
channel streamline while remaining close to the original elevations.
</p>

<p>Well-defined and smoothly-varying slopes along streamlines is
important when using the kinematic wave method of flow routing. </p>

<p>This algorithm is based on an implicit assumption of spatial
homogeneity in both the geology and climate, which may not be
satisfied for many DEMs.  However, the parameters c and p are
not treated as universal values but are determined on a case by case
basis from the input channel profile data.  The value of p will
typically be slightly greater than 0.5. </p>

<p>Note that errors in slope, S, along a channel as measured between grid
cells in a DEM can be very large, especially in DEMs for which elevations
have been rounded to the nearest foot or meter.  For example, with 10-meter
grid cells and a vertical resolution of one meter, the minimum resolvable,
nonzero slope is 0.1, whereas the actual slope could be less than 0.00001.
This factor of 10,000 difference represents an enormous error.  However,
contributing area, A, measured from a DEM depends only on the horizontal
resolution and therefore the relative error in A is very small for basins
that are much larger than the grid cell size.  It follows that even if
Flint's law is only an approximation, using it to compute channel slopes
from areas is likely to be more accurate than measuring slopes between grid
cells in the DEM.  Also, because of the inverse relationship between S and
A, the relative error in A is smallest for the larger basins where the
measured error in S is largest. </p>  

<p>This algorithm and code is based on unpublished work by S.D. Peckham.</p>
