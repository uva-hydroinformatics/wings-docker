<h2>Meteorology &rarr; Method 1</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This component reads a variety of variables for the atmosphere and for
the land surface from input files or as simple scalars.  It then computes many
additional variables, such as vapor pressure, e<sub>air</sub>, and net
shortwave (solar) radiation, Qn<sub>SW</sub>, using built-in
<b><a href="shortwave_calc.htm">shortwave radiation</a></b> and
<b><a href="longwave_calc.htm">longwave radiation</a></b> calculators that are
based on celestial mechanics and widely-used empirical relationships.
These additional variables are needed by the Snowmelt &rarr; Energy Balance and
Evaporation &rarr; Energy Balance components. </p>

<p>Direct, diffuse and back-scattered radiation fluxes are all modeled.
Properties of the atmosphere (e.g. precipitation rate, P,  air temperature,
T<sub>air</sub>, relative humidity, RH, and dust attenuation, &gamma;), are used
as well as surface/topographic properties (e.g. slope angle, aspect angle and surface
albedo.  The approach used here closely follows the one outlined in Appendix E of
Dingman (2002).  However, instantaneous vs. day-integrated radiation fluxes are used
and the optical air mass is modeled using the widely used method of Kasten and
Young (1989). </p>

<p>For each input variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>For DEMs with pixel geometry and bounding box given in terms of
Geographic coordinates, the latitude and longitude of each pixel is
used in the calculations.  For DEMs with a "fixed-length" pixel geometry
(e.g. UTM coordinates), which tend to span smaller areas, the dialog
prompts for a single lat/lon pair to be used in the calculations. </p>

<h3>Equations Used</h3>

<p> See References below. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p><b>time zone:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Boundaries of time zones can be very irregular and a time zone
map should be consulted if you are unsure.  The time zone is not
simply a function of the longitude.  You can select an adjacent
time zone to include the effect of Daylight Savings Time.  Time
zones with non-integer offsets from GMT are not yet supported. </p>

<p><b>slope:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Topographic slopes (not slope angles) are specified as dimensionless
numbers [m/m].  A RiverTools grid (RTG file) with extension
"_slope.rtg", "_mf-slope.rtg" or "_dinf-slope.rtg" can be used. </p>

<p><b>aspect:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Aspect is specified as an angle measured in radians counter-clockwise
from due east (the standard convention).
A RiverTools grid (RTG file) with extension "_mf-angle.rtg" or
"_dinf-angle.rtg" can be used for the (continuous-angle) aspect grid.
</p>

<p>Q<sub>SW</sub> is set to zero between the times of local sunset and
local sunrise, so frames in the RTS file that correspond to nighttime
hours will contain only zeros. </p>
