<h2>Infiltration &rarr; Beven's Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used by Beven's "Exponential-K" method
for modeling infiltration are defined as follows: </p>

<center> <table>
<td> K<sub>s</sub> </td>
<td> = saturated hydraulic conductivity [m / s] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> K<sub>i</sub> </td>
<td> = initial hydraulic conductivity [m / s]
       (typically much less than K<sub>s</sub>)  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &theta;<sub>s</sub> </td>
<td> = soil water content at &psi;=0 [unitless] 
       (typically set to the porosity, &phi;)  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &theta;<sub>i</sub> </td>
<td> = initial soil water content [unitless] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> L </td>
<td> = vertical length scale [meters] (see Notes below, L > 0) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> C </td>
<td> = storage suction factor [meters] = &Delta; &theta; * &Delta; &psi;
(see Notes below) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> K'<sub>0</sub> </td>
<td> = effective hydraulic conductivity at z=0 [m / s]
(see Notes below) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> P </td>
<td> = precipitation rate [mm / sec] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> M </td>
<td> = snowmelt rate [mm / sec] </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>For a detailed discussion of these variables see the
References below. </p>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p> Choosing an entry from the droplist labeled  "Closest standard soil type"
will change the values in the dialog to tabulated values for the selected
soil type.  However, these values were determined from plot-scale measurements
and are unlikely to be appropriate for large grid cells.  For large grid
cells, some type of <i><b>upscaling</b></i> is typically required. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>
<p><ol>
<li> t<sub>p</sub> = time of ponding [minutes] = the time when the soil
becomes saturated at the surface, after which v<sub>0</sub>=f<sub>c</sub>
or v<sub>0</sub>=0 (after surface inputs stop). If (P + M) < K<sub>s</sub>,
then ponding cannot occur. <br> <br>

<li> The equation for v<sub>0</sub> implies that v<sub>0</sub> = 0 whenever
(P + M) = 0, since f<sub>c</sub> > 0. <br> <br>

<li> If (P + M) > K<sub>s</sub>, then after a sufficiently long time
F will become large, the exponential term in the denominator will grow
much faster than the numerator and f<sub>c</sub> will decrease asymptotically
to 0.  This differs from the behavior of the Green-Ampt and Smith-Parlange
methods which approach K<sub>s</sub> for large times.  Perhaps
K<sub>s</sub> should simply be added to f<sub>c</sub> to correct this.
<br> <br>

<li> The definition of F implies that dF/dt = v<sub>0</sub>.  Here, F is
the quantity that Smith (2002) refers to as I', but that doesn't display
well in HTML. <br><br>

<li> The current implementation is meant for single events only
since F is only reset to 0 at the start of each model run. <br><br>

<li> Like the Green-Ampt and Smith-Parlange methods this method is based on
the <i><b>infiltrability-depth approximation</b></i> or IDA, which uses
the cumulative infiltrated depth as a "replacement" for time. For details, see
Smith (2002, pp. 71-73).  These methods are not well-suited to modeling
redistribution between events or drying of surface layers by evaporation.
They are best used for single events. <br><br>

<li> This method is based on the idea that the effective value of hydraulic
conductivity behind the wetting front, K', decreases exponentially with depth,
z, below the soil surface such that K'(z) = K'(0) * exp(-z/L).  It is assumed
that K'(0) < K<sub>s</sub>, which implies that K'(z) < K<sub>s</sub>. In the
notation of Beven (1984), L = (-1/f) and (f < 0).  Beven (1984) gives values
for f from regression analysis that range from -12.8 to -1.2. <br><br>

<li> Another key assumption of this method is that the <i><b>storage suction factor
</b></i>, C, as defined by Morel-Seytoux and Khanji (1974) can be taken to be a
constant.  Beven (1984) cites experiments by Childs and Bybordi (1969) for
which this was found to hold. <br><br>
