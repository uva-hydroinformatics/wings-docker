<h2>Infiltration &rarr; 1D Richards' Equation (3-layer) Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used for modeling infiltration and unsaturated
vertical flow with the 1D Richard's equation are defined as follows:
<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> K<sub>s</sub> </td>
<td> = saturated hydraulic conductivity [m / s] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> K<sub>i</sub> </td>
<td> = initial hydraulic conductivity [m / s]
       (typically much less than K<sub>s</sub>) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &theta;<sub>s</sub> </td>
<td> = soil water content at &psi; = 0 [unitless]
       (often set to the soil porosity, &phi;) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &theta;<sub>i</sub> </td>
<td> = initial soil water content [unitless] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &theta;<sub>r</sub> </td>
<td> = residual soil water content [unitless] (must be < &theta;<sub>i</sub>) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &psi;<sub>B</sub> </td>
<td> = bubbling pressure head [meters]
      (also called air-entry pressure, &psi;<sub>ae</sub>)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &psi;<sub>A</sub> </td>
<td> = pressure head offset parameter [meters] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &lambda; </td>
<td> = pore-size distribution parameter [unitless]  (alt. notation = 1/b ) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &eta; </td>
<td> = 2 + (3 * &lambda;) [unitless] (see Notes) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> c </td>
<td> = transitional Brooks-Corey curvature parameter [unitless] (see Notes) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> dz<sub>nodes</sub> </td>
<td> = vertical distance between nodes [meters] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> n<sub>nodes</sub> </td>
<td> = number of subsurface vertical nodes </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>Note that the names of Greek letters are spelled out in the
dialog, so theta = &theta;, psi = &psi; and lambda = &lambda;.
</p>

<p>The current version allows up to 3 different soil layers,
each with its own soil properties and number of vertical nodes.
The soil layer number is indicated at the top of the dialog
and you use the <b>Next</b> and <b>Back</b> buttons to view
settings for the various layers. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p> <ol>
<li>These equations are used to compute the time evolution of 1D
(vertical, subsurface) profiles for
(1) soil moisture, &theta;,
(2) pressure head, &psi;,
(3) hydraulic conductivity, K and
(4) vertical flow rate, v.  TopoFlow solves these equations
separately to get time-evolving profiles for every grid cell in a DEM.
The result is a 3D grid for each of these four variables that spans
the <b><i>unsaturated zone</i></b>.
The third equation above just defines a variable that is used in
the 4th and 5th equations, so the coupled set constitutes 4 equations
to be solved for 4 unknowns.  These equations can be combined into
one nonlinear, parabolic, second-order PDE (partial differential
equation) known as the <b><i>one-dimensional Richards' equation</i></b>.
</li> <br>

<li>The <b><i>infiltration rate</i></b> is simply the vertical flow
rate at the ground surface, denoted by v<sub>0</sub>. </li> <br>

<li><b><i>Soil moisture</i></b> is simply another term for the
water content in the case where the porous medium is a soil. </li> <br>

<li>Subscripts in the first two equations indicate partial derivatives
with respect to the vertical coordinate, z.  Note that z is the vertical
distance below the ground surface, in meters. </li> <br>

<li>More information on how soil is modeled in TopoFlow along with published soil
property tables can be found on this 
<b><i> <a href="soils_info.htm">soil properties page </a> </i></b>.
</li> <br>

<li>Two other, simpler methods for modeling infiltration are described on
the help pages for the <b><i> <a href="infil_Green-Ampt.htm">Green-Ampt method </a>
</i></b> and the <b><i> <a href="infil_Smith-Parlange.htm">Smith-Parlange 3-parameter
method. </a> </i></b>
</li> <br>
