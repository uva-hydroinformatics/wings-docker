<h2>Create &rarr; Channel Geometry Grids &rarr; With HS Order Grid</h2>

<p>This dialog allows you to create grids for several key channel
properties by parameterizing them in terms of a Horton-Strahler
order grid.  The channel cross-section is modeled as a trapezoid,
with bottom width, w, bank angle, a, and a Manning roughness
parameter, <i>n</i>.  The cross-section is triangular when w = 0, and
is rectangular when &theta; = 0.  For overland flow, (w >> d) and
R &rarr; d. Here, R is hydraulic radius and d is the flow depth.
</p>

<p>The lowest orders here correspond to grid cells on hillslopes
and by default, the transition from overland flow on hillslopes to
channelized flow is set to occur at a Horton-Strahler order of 4.
None of the default settings are expected to be valid in general.
</p>

<p>The bed width grid is special in the sense that for hillslope pixels
it is used to model overland flow.  The value for hillslope pixels is
therefore determined by the grid spacing and you should set the
Order 1 width to the DEM grid spacing. </p>

<p>A Manning's N value of 0.3 is often used for hillslopes, while
for channels, N is typically between 0.01 and 0.05, with 0.03
being a typical middle-range value.  N varies with the bed material
and may be modeled by Strickler's formula: N = D50^(1/6) / 21.2,
where D50 is median grain size in meters. </p>

<p>Bank angles should never be set to 90 degrees and should be set
to 0 on hillslopes.  If channel bed width is taken proportional to the
square root of discharge, then it should roughly double with a
unit increase in order.  Note that best results will be obtained
if measured vs. estimated values are used for each order. </p>
