<h2>Properties of Standard Soil Types</h2>

<p>The following table of soil parameters is based on Table 6-1 in Dingman (2002, p. 235).
It is based on the analysis of 1845 soils by Clapp and Hornberger (1978).
Values in parentheses are standard deviations.
Note that &psi;<sub>B</sub> is the <i>bubbling pressure head</i>, also known as the
<i>air entry pressure</i> and then denoted by &psi;<sub>ae</sub>. 
The parameter b is unitless and is known as the <i>pore-size distribution index</i>.
Its inverse, &lambda;, is also commonly used and is referred to in TopoFlow as the
<i>pore-size distribution parameter</i>. <br>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li>The equations above are empirical and allow the hydraulic
conductivity, K, and pressure head, &psi;, to be computed as functions
of the soil water content, &theta;. Such equations are called
<b><i>soil characteristic relations</i></b> (or equations or functions).
See Smith (2002, p. 13-23).
Changing the parameters in these equations allows different soil types to
be modeled.  Typical values have been tabulated for many standard soil types.
</li> <br>

<li>There is a missing minus sign in front of &lambda;
in Smith(2002, p. 19, eqn. 2.14 and eqn. 2.16), for the standard Brooks-Corey
relation.  It has been fixed above.
</li> <br>

<li>The soil characteristic relations used by TopoFlow
are those of the <b><i>transitional Brooks-Corey</i></b> (TBC) method.
This method combines the advantages of the well-known Brooks-Corey (1964) and
van Genuchten (1980) methods, as explained by Smith (2002).  A key difference
between the 3 methods is the value they give for &psi; when the soil becomes
saturated, that is, when &theta; = &theta;<sub>s</sub> or &Theta; = 1.
We usually want &psi; < 0 (capillary-type suction) above the water table where
&theta; < &theta;<sub>s</sub> and &psi; = 0 at the water table where
&theta; = &theta;<sub>s</sub>.  By inserting &Theta; = 1 into the equations
above, we find
<ul>
<li> for TBC:  &psi; = -&psi;<sub>A</sub> and K = K<sub>s</sub> (but often, &psi;<sub>A</sub> = 0) </li>
<li> for BC:   &psi; =  &psi;<sub>B</sub> and K = K<sub>s</sub> </li>
<li> for vG:   &psi; = 0 and K = K<sub>s</sub> </li>
</ul>
For BC, the &psi; curve can be made to rise vertically from &psi;<sub>B</sub>
to 0 at &Theta; = 1.  By design, the vG and TBC methods do not have this discontinuity
at saturation. 
</li> <br>

<li>Although K is computed quite differently for the transitional Brooks-Corey and
van Genuchten methods, the equations for &psi; are the same if we take:
&alpha;<sub>g</sub> = 1/&psi;<sub>B</sub>, n = c and m = &lambda;/c. 
</li> <br>

<li> Note that the <b><i>permanent wilting point</i></b> is associated with a
pressure head of -15,000 cm.  Water content associated with values less than
this is considered to be unavailable to plants.  The <b><i>field capacity</i></b>
is the soil water content associated with a pressure head of about -340 cm
and is an estimate of the water content that can be held against the force
of gravity.
</li> <br>

<li>Soils in nature do not have water contents lower than that corresponding
to <b><i>hygroscopic water</i></b> (Dingman, 2002, p. 236-238). At this
extreme dryness water is absorbed directly from the air.  The corresponding
pressure head (tension head) is -31,000 cm.
</li> <br>

<li>Note that we need to specify &theta;<sub>r</sub> and &theta;<sub>s</sub> in
order to compute a value of &theta; for a given value of &psi;.  Due to the way
in which &theta;<sub>r</sub> appears in the equations, we cannot solve for a
value of &theta;<sub>r</sub> given a value of &psi;.  However, in cases where
&theta;<sub>r</sub> << &theta; < &theta;<sub>s</sub>, we can approximate
&Theta; as (&theta; / &theta;<sub>s</sub>).
</li> <br>

<li>In view of the information above, TopoFlow 1.5 (IDL version) used: 
&theta;<sub>i</sub> = &theta;<sub>fc</sub> and <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &theta;<sub>r</sub> = &theta;<sub>s</sub> (-&psi;<sub>B</sub> / 10000)<sup> &lambda;</sup> 
<br>
as defaults.
This expression for &theta;<sub>r</sub> uses a reference pressure head of -10,000 meters
as the limit between air-dried and oven-dried soil.  See Dingman (2002, p. 237).
In addition, if a value of &theta;<sub>i</sub> was entered
that was less than the hygroscopic value, &theta;<sub>H</sub>, then &theta;<sub>H</sub>
was used instead.
</li> <br>

<li> In TopoFlow 3.0 (Python version), values of &theta;<sub>i</sub> and
K<sub>i</sub> are computed for TBC using the given values of &theta;<sub>r</sub>
and &theta;<sub>s</sub> and assuming that the initial pressure head in the
soil is that typically associated with the <i>field capacity</i>, i.e.
&psi = -340 cm.  In addition, the soil water content that corresponds to 
hygroscopic conditions (&psi = -31000 cm) is computed from the TBC parameters
and compared to &theta;<sub>r</sub>.  When using the Richards 1D infiltration
component, these values are printed in the CMT console window at the beginning
of the run and can be compared to the user-entered values as a consistency check.
</li> <br>

<li>The unsaturated zone extends from the soil surface all the way down
to the <b><i>water table</i></b>, where &theta; = &theta;<sub>s</sub>.
The water table is tracked by TopoFlow as a moving boundary, and may
actually rise up to the land surface in some places.  When this occurs,
a subsurface seepage term is included in the water balance equations.
Typically, &psi;<sub>A</sub> is set to zero so that the pressure
head is zero at the water table, but it can also be used to model
hysteresis effects, as explained by Smith (2002). </li> <br>

<li>The <b><i>pore disconnectedness index</i></b>, c, is a measure of the ratio
of the length of the path followed by water in the soil to a straight-line path
(Eagleson 1978; Bras 1990).  It is unitless and can be approximated as: <br> <br>
      <center> c = 2*b + 3 </center> <br>
where b is again the unitless <b><i>pore-size distribution index</i></b>.
This is consistent with the expression: <br>
      <br>
      <center> &eta; = 2 + 3*&lambda; </center> <br>
used by Smith (2002), because <br>
      <center> c = &eta; / &lambda; = &eta; * b. </center>
</li> <br>

<li>The <b><i>capillary length scale</i></b>, G, is a parameter that appears in both
the Green-Ampt and Smith-Parlange 3-parameter methods of modeling infiltration
(Smith, 2002, p. 69).  For an initially dry soil (so we can neglect K<sub>i</sub>),
G can be computed by integrating K(&psi;)/K<sub>s</sub> over all values
(-Infinity to 0) of the pressure head, &psi;. As indicated by Smith (2002, p. 71),
G can be computed in closed form for the Brooks-Corey (BC) relations to get: <br> <br>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
       G = -&psi;<sub>B</sub> * [&eta; / (&eta; - 1)]. <br> <br>
For the <b>transitional Brooks-Corey (TBC)</b> relations with &psi;<sub>A</sub> = 0,
the following appears to be a general expression for G: <br> <br>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
       G =  -&psi;<sub>B</sub> * Gamma[1 + 1/c] * Gamma[(&eta; - 1) / c] / Gamma[&eta; / c]
<br> <br>
(Found by S. Peckham on 11/1/2010 by first finding expressions for c=1, c=3/2 and c=2 and
then working out the pattern.  Note also that the TBC expression for G approaches the
BC expression in the limit as c becomes large.  This is consistent with the comment
by Smith (2002, p. 22) that TBC approaches BC in that limit.  But for smaller
values of c, they can be quite different.  For example, if c=2 and &lambda;=1,
BC  gives G = (-5/4) * &psi;<sub>B</sub> while
TBC gives G = (-2/3) * &psi;<sub>B</sub>.)
Recall that &eta; = 2 + 3*&lambda;.  Some values of the general Gamma function are:
Gamma[1/2] = sqr(&pi;), Gamma[1]=1, Gamma[3/2] = sqrt(&pi;)/2, Gamma[2]=1,
Gamma[n+1] = n * Gamma[n], even if n is not an integer.<br> <br>

These expressions for G can be used when comparing results from the Green-Ampt,
Smith-Parlange and Richards 1D methods of modeling infiltration.
Note that the statement made by Smith(2002, p. 71) about G being in the interval
[-&psi;<sub>B</sub>, -2 * &psi;<sub>B</sub>] only holds for the BC relation and
relies on the fact that &eta; > 2 when &lambda; > 0. <br> <br>

If there is a depth of water at the surface, d<sub>s</sub>, then G should be replaced
by (G + d<sub>s</sub>) in the Green-Ampt and Smith-Parlange equations (Smith, 2002, p. 84).
Keep in mind, however, that this should be a water depth that is uniformly distributed
over a grid cell and not the depth of water in a channel that is contained within the
grid cell.
</li> <br>

<li>Let r<sub>0</sub> be the rate at which water enters the top of the soil
profile. If (r<sub>0</sub> >= K<sub>s</sub>), then the limiting value of
the soil moisture content, &theta;, will be the saturated value, &theta;<sub>s</sub>.
However, if (r<sub>0</sub> < K<sub>s</sub>), then the limiting, maximum value of &theta;
will be less than the saturated value and turns out to be the same for the
Brooks-Corey and transitional Brooks-Corey relations.  It is computed by setting
K = r<sub>0</sub> in the relations and solving for &theta;. </li> <br>
