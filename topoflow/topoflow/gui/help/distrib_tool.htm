<h2>Create &rarr; RTS File from Station Data</h2>

<p>This preprocessing tool reads any type of data that was measured
over time at discrete locations, here called "stations", from a
multi-column text file and then uses the <b><i>Inverse Distance
Method</i></b> (IDM) to create a corresponding sequence of spatial
grids with the same georeferencing as the DEM. </p>

<p>The format of the multi-column text must be as follows.  There can be
any number of header lines, but typically there will be one with the
column headers Time, Station_1, Station_2 and so on followed by a
second line that consists of hyphens.  After the line of hyphens, the
next two lines must begin with "X" and "Y" and give the X and Y
coordinates of the stations (UTM/meters or Geographic/decimal degrees).
That is, "X" and "Y" appear in the Time column of the first two rows.
The values that were measured at each station over time are then listed
in the subsequent rows, with each row containing the time followed by
the values measured at each station at that time.  If no value is
available at a given station for a given time, then a nodata value of
-9999.0 must be provided;  it cannot be left blank or set to any
other value.  Values in a row may be separated by blank space or by
commas.  Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
Time	Station_1	Station_2	Station_3	Station_4
--------------------------------------------------------------------
X	50		2950		50		2950
Y	2950		2950		50		50
1.0	20.0		20.0		20.0		20.0
2.0	10.0		15.0		5.0		6.0
3.0	30.0		5.0		7.0		-9999.0
</pre>

<p>The number of header lines to be skipped in the station data file
must be provided in the dialog, as well as the parameter "p" that is
required by the Inverse Distance Method (IDM).  The equation for the
IDM is: <br>
<center>
Z(x,y) = &Sigma;<sub>k=1,N</sub>
          [Z<sub>k</sub> / d<sub>k</sub>(x,y)<sup>p</sup>] /
         &Sigma;<sub>k=1,N</sub> [1 / d<sub>k</sub>(x,y)<sup>p</sup>],
</center> <br>
where N is the number of stations, d<sub>k</sub>(x,y) is the distance from the
pixel at (x,y) to the kth station, and Z<sub>k</sub> is the value that was
measured at the kth station at a given time. </p>
