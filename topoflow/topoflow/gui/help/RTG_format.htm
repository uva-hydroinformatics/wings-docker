<h2>RTG File Format (RiverTools Grid)</h2>

<p>RiverTools Grid (RTG) are binary files with no header that
store a 2D array (or grid) whose dimensions and georeferencing
are same as the DEM (*_DEM.rtg) they were derived from.  They
may, however, have a different data type than the associated
DEM.  Values in the file are stored in <b>row major</b> order;
that is, values for the first (north) row are followed by values
for the second row, and so on.  The filesize for an RTG file is
always equal to the following product: </p>

<center> <p>
filesize = (ncols x nrows x BPE)
</p> </center>

<p>where <b>BPE</b> is the number of Bytes Per Element in
the 2D array. The possible data types for an RTG file are
<b>BYTE</b>, <b>INTEGER</b>, <b>LONG</b>, <b>FLOAT</b>, and
<b>DOUBLE</b>.  The corresponding values of BPE
are 1, 2, 4, 4, and 8. Each RTG file has a data type that is
appropriate for the range of possible values that array can
contain. This use of the most "economical" data type results
in more efficient use of disk space and faster access times.
Georeferencing information associated with an RTG file is
stored in a plain text file in the <b><a href="RTI_format.htm">
RTI file format</a></b>. </p>

<p>Given the number of rows and columns in the DEM (nrows and
ncols), the data type of an RTG file can be deduced from its
filesize in all cases except when BPE is equal to 4. In this
case, the data type could be either LONG or FLOAT, and
additional information is required in order to determine
which one.  A standard, recognized filename extension is one
method for deciding between these two data types. </p>
