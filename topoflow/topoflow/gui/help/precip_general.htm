<h2>Precipitation &rarr; General Data Types Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used for this Precipitation method are defined as follows:
<br>
<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> rate </td>
<td> = precipitation rate [mm/hr]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> duration </td>
<td> = precip. duration of a given rate [minutes] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> T_air </td>
<td> = air temperature [deg C] </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>Precipitation falls as snow (and snow depth is incremented)
whenever the air temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius.
If air temperatures are specified in another input dialog, such
as those for Evapotranspiration and Snowmelt, those values
will take precedence over values entered here.</p>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units that are indicated in the dialog.  For the other data
types, enter a filename.  The values in the file must also have
the indicated units.
</p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If rainrates are entered as a grid sequence in
the RTS file format, then the corresponding durations between
frames should be entered as a time series with the same number
of values as there are frames in the RTS file.  You will need
to create a time series of durations even if all of the durations
are the same.  For periods with no rain, the grid sequence of
spatial rainrates should contain one frame in which all the values
are zero and the time series of durations should contain a
corresponding scalar value which gives the number of minutes for
which there is no rain. </p>
