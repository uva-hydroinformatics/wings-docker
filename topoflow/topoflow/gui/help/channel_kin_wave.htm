<h2>Channel Flow &rarr; Kinematic Wave Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used for the Kinematic Wave method of
routing flow in channels are defined as follows:</p>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> bank_angle </td>
<td> = bank angle for trapezoid [deg] (from vertical) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> sinuosity </td>
<td> = channel sinuosity [unitless] (along-channel / straight length) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> init_depth </td>
<td> = initial water depth [m] (See Notes below) </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The input variables for the kinematic wave method
should usually be specified as grids, except in special cases.
</p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>Flow directions are determined by a grid of D8 flow codes,
and flow codes are assumed to follow the Jenson (1984)
convention (see above) that is also used for RiverTools D8
flow grids. Flow grids and slope grids can be created by
RiverTools or a similar program and the other grids can be
created using tools in the TopoFlow Create menu. </p>

<p>Bed slope, S, can be computed from a DEM by using the
<a href="smooth_DEM.htm">
<i><b>Create &rarr; Profile-smoothed DEM</b></i> </a> dialog or
by using hydrologic GIS software such as RiverTools.
<b>Important Note:</b> In the current version of TopoFlow (1.5 beta),
pixels in flat areas where the slope is zero are arbitrarily
assigned a positive value equal to the smallest positive slope that
occurs in the DEM.  If they were not assigned a positive value, then
flow would accumulate at these pixels, leading to unrealistic spikes
in the grid of flow depths. However, this work-around could lead to
unrealistically large velocities at these locations. </p>

<p>The current version assumes that all channels have <i><b>trapezoidal
cross-sections</b></i> (see Notes below) but allows bottom-width and
bank angle to vary spatially as grids.
TopoFlow has pre-processing tools in the <b>Create</b> menu
for creating grids of bed width, bank angle and bed roughness.  
The <a href="channel_grids_area.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr; Channel
Geometry Grids &rarr; With Area Grid</i></b> </a> tool allows
you to parameterize these variables as power-law functions of
contributing area.
The <a href="channel_grids_order.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr;
Channel Geometry Grids &rarr; With HS Order Grid</i></b> </a>
tool allows you to assign values based on Horton-Strahler order.
</p>

<p>Each pixel is classified as either a hillslope pixel (overland
flow) or a channel pixel (channelized flow) and appropriate
parameters must be used for each.  For overland flow, w >> d,
R<sub>h</sub> &rarr; d, and bank angle drops out.  Overland flow can then be
modeled with a large value of Manning's <i>n</i>, such as 0.3.
For channelized flow, the variation of <i>n</i> with bed grain
size can be modeled with Strickler's equation (see Notes below).
RiverTools users can use the Grid Calculator as a convenient way
to create new grids as functions of existing grids. </p>

<p>If a sinuosity greater than 1 is specified, then bed slopes
are reduced by dividing them by this value.  As with the other
variables, it is most appropriate to specify a grid in this case.
</p>

<p><b>Important Note</b>:  It is physically unrealistic to specify
a spatially uniform initial flow depth by entering a scalar value
greater than zero for <i>init_depth</i>.  This will result in a
very large peak in the hydrograph and may cause TopoFlow to crash.
The <a href="init_depth.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr; RTG File for
Initial Depth</i></b> </a>  tool can be used to create a grid of
initial flow depths that varies spatially and is in steady-state
equilibrium with a specified baseflow recharge rate. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p><b>Conservation of mass</b>, in integral form, is represented by the first
three equations above.  The quantity, R, that appears in the first equation is
known as the <b><i>effective rainrate</i></b> or <b><i>excess rainrate</i></b>
and represents the sum of all vertical contributions to a grid cell's mass
balance.  R is computed as R = (P + M + G) - (I + E), where P = precipitation,
M = snowmelt, G = seepage from subsurface, I = infiltration and E = evapotranspiration.
(Note that R is technically <b>not</b> the same as the <b><i>runoff</i></b>, since
runoff includes horizontal fluxes.)  The summation sign in the first equation
adds up all horizontal inflows to a grid cell from its neighbor grid cells.
Mean channel flow depth, d, is then computed from channel geometry and the
water volume that is computed for the corresponding grid cell.  Note that channel
length depends on distance between grid cell centers and sinuosity, while
cross-sections are trapezoidal.  When the bank angle, &theta; is greater than
zero, the flow depth required to accomodate the water volume is computed by
solving the last equation (a quadratic) for d to get the second equation. </p>

<p>The <b>kinematic wave</b> method (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955) is the
simplest method for modeling flow in open channels.
This method combines mass conservation with the
simplest possible treatment of momentum conservation, namely that all
terms in the general momentum equation (pressure gradient, local acceleration
and convective acceleration) are neglible except the friction and gravity
terms.  A flow in which gravitational acceleration is exactly balanced by
friction is referred to as <i><b>steady, uniform flow</b></i>.  For these flows
the water surface slope, energy slope and bed slope are all equal.
For a thin channel section of length &Delta;s in the downstream direction,
the total weight of water (resolved parallel to the channel bed) is given by:
<br> <br>
<center>
F<sub>grav</sub> = &rho; * g * S * A<sub>w</sub> * &Delta;s,
</center> <br>
where &rho; is the density of water, g is the gravitational constant,
A<sub>w</sub> is the wetted cross-sectional area of the channel and
S is the bed slope (rise over run).
According to our best theoretical understanding of turbulent boundary
layers (Schlicting, 1960), the <i><b>shear stress</b></i> near the
channel bed can be computed as:
<br> <br>
<center>
&tau;<sub>b</sub> = f * &rho; * v<sup>2</sup>
</center> <br>
where v is an appropriate flow velocity (e.g. depth-averaged for a wide, trapezoidal
channel) and f is a dimensionless <i><b>friction factor</b></i> given by
<br> <br>
<center>
f = [ &kappa; / LN ( a * d / z<sub>0</sub>) ]<sup>2</sup>.
</center> <br>
Here, d is an appropriate flow depth (i.e. distance along a ray to the surface),
z<sub>0</sub> is the <i><b>roughness height</b></i> (units of length),
a is an integration constant (given by 0.368 or 0.476, depending on the formulation),
and &kappa; = 0.408 is <b><i>von Karman's constant</i></b>.  It follows that for a
thin channel section of length &Delta;s in the downstream direction, the total
frictional force can be written as:
<br> <br>
<center>
F<sub>fric</sub> = &Tau;<sub>b</sub> * P<sub>w</sub> * &Delta;s
</center> <br>
where P<sub>w</sub> is the <b><i>wetted perimeter</i></b> of the channel cross section
and &Tau;<sub>b</sub> is the average of &tau<sub>b</sub> over the wetted perimeter.
As a first approximation (based on our expression for &tau;<sub>b</sub>), we can take
<br> <br>
<center>
&Tau;<sub>b</sub> = f * &rho; * v<sup>2</sup>,
</center> <br>
where v is the section-averaged velocity.  Combining the above equations,
setting F<sub>grav</sub> equal to F<sub>fric</sub> and solving for v we find that:
<br> <br>
<center>
v = ( g * R<sub>h</sub> * S / f )<sup>1/2</sup>
</center> </p>
where R<sub>h</sub> = (A<sub>w</sub> / P<sub>w</sub>)
is known as the <i><b>hydraulic radius</b></i>.  When we substitute the friction
factor, f, from above (but perhaps with d replaced by R<sub>h</sub>), the resulting
expression is known as the <b>law of the wall</b>.  </p>

<p>Note that the law of the wall is a general result for turbulent flows
and is also used by the snowmelt energy-balance
models for modeling air flow in the atmospheric boundary layer. However, in the setting
of open-channel flow, an alternative known as <i><b>Manning's formula</b></i> is more
often used.  Manning's formula, which was determined by fitting a power-law to data
gives the section-averaged velocity as:
<br> <br>
<center>
v = R<sub>h</sub><sup>2/3</sup> * S<sup>1/2</sup> / n.
</center> <br>
Here n is an empirical roughness parameter with the units of [s/m<sup>1/3</sup>] required to
make the equation dimensionally consistent.  Due to the empirical nature of this equation,
the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly and the balance between friction
and gravity is not readily apparent.  The variation of n with channel bed grain
size is often modeled with Strickler's equation:
<br> <br>
<center>
n = D<sub>50</sub><sup>1/6</sup> / 21.2
</center> <br>
where D<sub>50</sub> is the median grain size in meters.  This approximation can actually
be deduced by requiring Manning's formula to agree with the law of the wall and by
assuming that z<sub>0</sub> is proportional to D<sub>50</sub>. 
It turns out that Manning's formula agrees very well with
the law of the wall as long as the relative roughness, (z<sub>0</sub> / d) is between
about 10<sup>-2</sup> and 10<sup>-4</sup>.  This is the range that is encountered in
most open-channel flow problems.  Smaller relative roughnesses are typically encountered
in the case where wind blows over terrain and vegetation.</p>

<p>For a channel with a <i><b>trapezoidal cross-section</b></i> that has  bottom-width,
w and bank-angle, &theta;, we have:
<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> A<sub>w</sub> </td>
<td> = d * [w + (d * tan(&theta;))] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> P<sub>w</sub> </td>
<td> = w + [2 * d / cos(&theta;)] </td>
</tr>
</table> </center> <br>
These last two equations can be used to show that
R<sub>h</sub> = (A<sub>w</sub> / P<sub>w</sub>)
is closely approximated by the flow depth, d, when (w / d) has
a value greater than about 10.  Notice that when &theta;=0, the
channel has a rectangular cross-section, and when w=0, it has a
triangular cross-section.</p>
