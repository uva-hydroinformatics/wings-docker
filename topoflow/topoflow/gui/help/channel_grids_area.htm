<h2>Create &rarr; Channel Geometry Grids &rarr; With Area Grid</h2>
<p>
This dialog allows you to create grids for several key channel
properties by parameterizing them in terms of a contributing
area grid, denoted as A.  The channel cross-section is modeled
as a trapezoid, with bottom width, w, bank angle, a, and a
Manning roughness parameter, <i>n</i>.  The cross-section is
triangular when w = 0, and is rectangular when &theta; = 0. </p>

<p> The curve-fitting formulas shown have been selected for their
ability to fit widely observed trends in hydraulic variables. </p>

<p>Enter measured values into the bottom table and click on the button
labeled "Update c, b and p".  The parameters c, b and p will be
updated in the top table to give the best fit to the measured values.
Note that the rows in the bottom table are labeled Overland, Transition
and Channel.  The Overland row represents the hillslopes and the
endmember case where A=0.  The Transition row represents an
approximate threshold area where hillslopes end and channelized flow
begins.  The Channel row represents values for a well-defined channel
in the model basin that has a large contributing area. </p>

<p>The bed width grid is special in the sense that for hillslope pixels
it is used to model overland flow.  The value for hillslope pixels is
therefore determined by the grid spacing and you should leave the
width in the Overland row set to zero. Technically, there should be
no channels below the threshold area.</p>

<p>A Manning's N value of 0.3 is often used for hillslopes (A=0),
while for channels, N is typically between 0.01 and 0.05, with 0.03
being a typical middle-range value.  N varies with the bed material
and may be modeled by Strickler's formula: <br>
<center>
N = D<sub>50</sub><sup>1/6</sup> / 21.2, <br><br>
</center>
where D<sub>50</sub> is median grain size in meters. </p>

<p>The value of p for bed width should be close to 0.5, and the value
of p for Manning's N should be negative.  The value of p for bank
angle can be set to 0 to indicate that bank angles do not change
with increasing area. Bank angles should never be set to 90 degrees
and should be set to 0 on hillslopes. </p>
