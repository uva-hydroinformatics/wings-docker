<h2>Subsurface Flow &rarr; Darcy, Surface-parallel Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used for modeling horizontal subsurface flow
in the <b><i>saturated zone</i></b> via Darcy's Law are defined as
follows:

<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> K<sub>s</sub> </td>
<td> = saturated hydraulic conductivity [m / s] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> S<sub>y</sub> </td>
<td> = specific yield or drainable porosity [unitless] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>  </td>
<td> &nbsp;&nbsp; (less than or equal to the porosity, &phi;, see Notes) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> thickness </td>
<td> = soil layer thickness [meters] </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also have the indicated
units. </p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>It is possible to have six different soil layers, each with
different parameter values.  The <b><i>soil layer number</i></b>
is indicated at the top of the dialog and the <b>Next</b> and
<b>Back</b> buttons in the top section can be used to select a
layer.  In order to use fewer than six layers, a layer can be made
<b><i>impermeable</i></b> by either setting K<sub>s</sub> = 0 or
&theta;<sub>s</sub> = 0 for that layer.  All layers below an
impermeable layer are then ignored. </p>

<p>Note that the thickness of a layer can vary spatially;  this
requires choosing "Grid" from the droplist that specifies the
thickness "Type". </p>

<p><b>Important Note:</b> The <b><i>Depth to bedrock</i></b> settings
are not yet used in this beta version. </p>

<h3>Equations Used by the Darcy, Surface-parallel Method</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td> Q(k) </td>
<td> = v<sub>hor</sub>(k) * y(k) * b  &nbsp; </td>
<td> = horizontal discharge out of grid cell in kth layer [m<sup>3</sup> / s] </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> v<sub>hor</sub>(k) &nbsp; </td>
<td> = K<sub>s</sub>(k) * S<sub>H</sub> </td>
<td> = horizontal flow rate [m / s] &nbsp; (from Darcy's Law) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> S<sub>H</sub> </td>
<td> = (H<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> + H<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> </td>
<td> = local slope of the water table [unitless] (see Notes below) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> &Delta;H / &Delta;t </td>
<td> = [ R - &Sigma; Q(k) / (&Delta;x &Delta;y) ] / S<sub>y</sub> </td>
<td> = integral form of mass balance [m / s] (see Notes below) </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the first equation, y(k), is the <b><i>saturated thickness</i></b> of the kth
layer and b is the <b><i>flow width</i></b> perpedicular to the direction of flow.
Note that b is the same for all layers, by assumption, and depends on the D8 flow
direction.  Both y(k) and b have units of meters. </p>

<p>In the last equation, R is the <b><i>recharge rate</i></b>, or the vertical
infiltration rate just above the water table, and &Delta;x and &Delta;y are th
 DEM grid cell
dimensions.  The notation &Sigma; Q(k) denotes the sum of all flows that are
either into a grid cell from neighboring cells or out of the cell.  This
corresponds to a boundary integral of the flow field around the grid cell
boundary. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p>This method makes a number of simplifying assumptions that are important
to understand.  It is intended for modeling <b><i>unconfined aquifers
</i></b>, which have a <b><i>water table</i></b>, H(x,y), as their upper
boundary.  The <b><i>Dupuit assumptions</i></b> are often used for unconfined
aquifers and are used here, namely:
<ol>
<li>flow lines are horizontal and equipotential lines are vertical and
<li>the horizontal hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the free surface
(the water table) and is invariant with depth.
</ol>
In addition, the saturated hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be
<b><i>isotropic</i></b> throughout any given layer, so that a single value,
K<sub>s</sub>, can be used in both the x and y coordinate directions.
Note that this does not prevent K<sub>s</sub> from varying spatially as
a function of x and y. </p>

<p>Another key assumption of this method is that the subsurface flow
direction is always the same as the surface flow direction to within an
angle of 45 degrees; that is, the D8 flow direction found from Z(x,y)
(provided as a DEM) is always used for the subsurface flow.  Put another
way, the gradient vectors for H(x,y) and Z(x,y) are assumed to differ by
less than 45 degrees.  (Notice, however, that S<sub>H</sub>, which is
the <b><i>magnitude</i></b>
of the gradient vector for H(x,y), is used in Darcy's Law.)  This
assumption allows an integral vs. differential form of mass balance to
be applied to the soil column that lies below any given DEM grid cell.
That is, instead of numerically solving a second-order PDE known as the
<b><i>Boussinesq equation</i></b> by the finite-difference method, the
amounts flowing across the soil column's six faces and the amount stored
within the soil column and the requirement of mass balance are used to
compute changes to the height of the water table.
Since the subsurface flow direction is always taken to be the same as
the surface flow direction, this method does not allow subsurface flow to
cross beneath a drainage divide. </p>

<p>The <b><i>water table</i></b>, H(x,y), is a dynamic surface (a moving
boundary), and may actually rise up to the land surface in some places.
Both the land surface, Z(x,y), (given by a DEM) and the water table are
represented as grids (or 2D arrays).  Wherever H(x,y) is greater than
Z(x,y), mass balance is used to compute a <b><i>seepage rate</i></b>
from the subsurface that contributes to the surface runoff. </p> 

<p>Control volumes just above the water table have <b><i>horizontal flow
</i></b> into or out of their 4 vertical faces as well as <b><i>vertical
flow</i></b> into (or out of) their top face.  The top face has the
dimensions of a DEM grid cell. 
Horizontal flow rates (in the saturated layers below the water table)
are determined by Darcy's Law, while the vertical flow rate (in the
unsaturated zone just above the water table) is determined by the method
that the user has selected for modeling the infiltration process.
If the net flow into the control volume is positive, then the water content
increases (up to a maximum of &theta;<sub>s</sub>), the saturated thickness
increases (up to a maximum of the layer thickness) and the water table rises
locally as required to conserve mass.  Similarly, if it is negative, the
water table falls. </p>

<p>The <b><i>specific yield</i></b> or <b><i>drainable porosity</i></b>
refers to the water content, as a volumetric fraction, that can be made
to flow out of a control volume in response to a water table gradient.
Note that the <b><i>porosity</i></b>, &phi;, is a volumetric fraction that
defines the amount of void space in a given porous medium that water could
potentially occupy.  However, there are some air spaces that remain unfilled
even when a porous medium is saturated, so the <b><i>saturated water content
</i></b>, &theta;<sub>s</sub>, is always somewhat smaller than the porosity.
Similary, it is generally not possible to remove all of the water in a
given porous medium through the application of a head gradient;  there is
generally some residual amount that remains within the pores, unless the
soil is desicated by some other means.  This amount is known as the
<b><i>residual water content</i></b>, &theta;<sub>r</sub>.  It follows
that S<sub>y</sub> = (&theta;<sub>s</sub> - &theta;<sub>r</sub>). </p> 

<p><b>Note:</b> In the current implementation of this method, discharges from
all layers are summed in order to determine the net horizontal flow into
soil columns (cylindrical control volumes) that extend up to the land surface.
The water table height is then adjusted accordingly to conserve mass.  If the
net flow into a deep, saturated layer is positive (perhaps due to convergent
horizontal flow lines) then this approach causes the excess water to be
transferred up to the water table in a single time step.  Depending on how 
K<sub>s</sub> varies with distance below the ground surface, z, and how thick
the layers are, this may not be physically realistic. </p>

<p>The values of S<sub>y</sub>, &theta;<sub>s</sub> and
&theta;<sub>r</sub> are all dimensionless and must be between 0 and 1.
Freeze & Cherry (1979, Table 2.4) give the following table with typical
values of &theta;<sub>s</sub> for various soil types.
