<h2>Channel Flow &rarr; Diffusive Wave Method</h2>

<p>The input variables used for the Diffusive Wave method of
routing flow in channels are defined as follows:</p>

<center> <table>
<tr>
<td> flow_codes </td>
<td> = D8 flow codes (Jenson convention) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      [NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,N] &rarr; [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> bed_slope </td>
<td> = slope of the channel bed or hillslope [m / m] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Manning_n </td>
<td> = Manning roughness parameter [s / m<sup>1/3</sup>] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> bed_width </td>
<td> = bed width for trapezoidal cross-section [m] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> bank_angle </td>
<td> = bank angle for trapezoid [deg] (from vertical) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> sinuosity </td>
<td> = channel sinuosity [unitless] (along-channel / straight length) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> init_depth </td>
<td> = initial water depth [m] (See Notes below) </td>
</tr>
</table> </center>

<p>For each variable, you may choose from the droplist of data
types.  For the "Scalar" data type, enter a numeric value with
the units indicated in the dialog.  For the other data types,
enter a filename.  Values in files must also use the indicated
units. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The input variables for the diffusive wave method
should usually be specified as grids, except in special cases.
</p>

<p>Single grids and grid sequences are assumed to be stored as
<b><i> <a href="RTG_format.htm">RTG </a> </i></b> and
<b><i> <a href="RTS_format.htm">RTS</a> </i></b> files, respectively.
Time series are assumed to be stored as text files, with one value
per line. For a time series or grid sequence, the time between
values must coincide with the timestep provided. </p>

<p>Flow directions are determined by a grid of D8 flow codes.
All grids are assumed to be stored as RTG (RiverTools Grid)
files and flow codes are assumed to follow the Jenson (1984)
convention (see above) that is also used for RiverTools D8
flow grids. Flow grids and slope grids can be created by
RiverTools or a similar program and the other grids can be
created using tools in the TopoFlow Create menu. </p>

<p>Bed slope, S, can be computed from a DEM by using the
<a href="smooth_DEM.htm">
<i><b>Create &rarr; Profile-smoothed DEM</b></i> </a> dialog or
by using hydrologic GIS software such as RiverTools. </p>

<p>The current version assumes that all channels have <i><b>
trapezoidal cross-sections</b></i> (see Notes below) but allows
bottom-width and bank angle to vary spatially as grids.
TopoFlow has pre-processing tools in the <b>Create</b> menu
for creating grids of bed width, bank angle and bed roughness.  
The <a href="channel_grids_area.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr; Channel
Geometry Grids &rarr; With Area Grid</i></b> </a> tool allows
you to parameterize these variables as power-law functions of
contributing area.
The <a href="channel_grids_order.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr;
Channel Geometry Grids &rarr; With HS Order Grid</i></b> </a>
tool allows you to assign values based on Horton-Strahler order.
</p>

<p>Each pixel is classified as either a hillslope pixel (overland
flow) or a channel pixel (channelized flow) and appropriate
parameters must be used for each.  For overland flow, w >> d,
R<sub>h</sub> &rarr; d, and bank angle drops out.  Overland flow
can then be
modeled with a large value of Manning's <i>n</i>, such as 0.3.
For channelized flow, the variation of <i>n</i> with bed grain
size can be modeled with Strickler's equation as explained in
the Notes below. </p>

<p>If a sinuosity greater than 1 is specified, then bed slopes
are reduced by dividing them by this value.  As with the other
variables, it is most appropriate to specify a grid in this case.
</p>

<p><b>Important Note</b>:  It is physically unrealistic to specify
a spatially uniform initial flow depth by entering a scalar value
greater than zero for <i>init_depth</i>.  This will result in a
very large peak in the hydrograph and may cause TopoFlow to crash.
The <a href="init_depth.htm"> <b><i>Create &rarr; RTG File for
Initial Depth</i></b> </a>  tool can be used to create a grid of
initial flow depths that varies spatially and is in steady-state
equilibrium with a specified baseflow recharge rate. </p>

<h3>Notes on the Equations</h3>

<p><b>Conservation of mass</b>, in integral form, is represented by the first
three equations above.  The quantity, R, that appears in the first equation is
known as the <b><i>effective rainrate</i></b> or <b><i>excess rainrate</i></b>
and represents the sum of all vertical contributions to a grid cell's mass
balance.  R is computed as R = (P + M + G) - (I + E), where P = precipitation,
M = snowmelt, G = seepage from subsurface, I = infiltration and E = evapotranspiration.
(Note that R is technically <b>not</b> the same as the <b><i>runoff</i></b>, since
runoff includes horizontal fluxes.)  The summation sign in the first equation
adds up all horizontal inflows to a grid cell from its neighbor grid cells.
Mean channel flow depth, d, is then computed from channel geometry and the
water volume that is computed for the corresponding grid cell.  Note that channel
length depends on distance between grid cell centers and sinuosity, while
cross-sections are trapezoidal.  When the bank angle, &theta; is greater than
zero, the flow depth required to accomodate the water volume is computed by
solving the last equation (a quadratic) for d to get the second equation. </p>

<p>The <b>diffusive wave</b> method is similar to the <i><b>kinematic wave</b></i>
method for modeling flow in open channels, but instead of a simple balance between
friction and gravity, this method includes the pressure gradient that is induced
by a water-depth gradient in the downstream direction.  This means that instead
of using bed slope in Manning's equation or the law of the wall, the
<b>water-surface slope</b> is used.  One consequence of this is that water is able
to move across flat areas that have a bed slope of zero.  Local and convective
accelerations in the momentum equations are still neglected, just as is done in
the kinematic wave method.  For more information, see the help page for the
<i><b><a href="channel_kin_wave.htm">kinematic wave</a></b></i> method. </p> 

<p><b>Note:</b>  In the current version of TopoFlow (1.5 beta), water-surface
slopes are set to zero if they ever become negative (implying upstream flow). </p>
